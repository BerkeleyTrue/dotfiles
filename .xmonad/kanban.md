## To Do

- clean up hooks
  > hooks are all in different formats. These should be a little more uniform
- move to xdg_conf_home
  > These files should live in dvl/haskell dir
- move to standalone tray
  > Trayer is annoying to configure and ignores struct toggling
- fix picom transparency
  > No idea why this isn't working
- move to taffybar
  > Don't like the xmobar uses a psuedo haskell file
