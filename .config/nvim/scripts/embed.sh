# Copies a dependency's Lua from deps (result of dep.sh) into your own Lua
# directory under a prefix directory. Then munges the dependency to (hopefully)
# replace all occurrences of the module paths with your unique project specific prefix.
# This, in most cases, should prevent your version conflicting with
# other plugins. It might however completely break the Lua, so use at your own risk.
# Should be totally safe with Aniseed but this script makes a LOT of assumptions.
# Args: Dependency name, your project module prefix, optional src dir.
# Usage: deps/aniseed/scripts/embed.sh aniseed your-plugin-name
# Usage (with src): deps/aniseed/scripts/embed.sh sha1 your-plugin-name src/sha1/
