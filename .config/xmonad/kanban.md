## Doing


## Done

- move to src dir

  * [x] update cabal file
  * [x] update haskell build file
  * [x] update stack build
- move to xdg_conf_home
  > These files should live in dvl/haskell dir
- add xmobar compile script
- clean up hooks
  > hooks are all in different formats. These should be a little more uniform
- add dynamic scratpad
- seperate by CCP
  * [ ] mouse bindings
  * [ ] manage hooks
- fix picom transparency
  > No idea why this isn't working
- move to standalone tray
  > Trayer is annoying to configure and ignores struct toggling
  > UPDATE: can't get stalone tray to even appear. Lame
